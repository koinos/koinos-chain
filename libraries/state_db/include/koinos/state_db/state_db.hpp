/**
 * database is designed to provide parallel access to the database across
 * different states.
 *
 * It does by tracking positive state deltas, which can be merged on the fly
 * at read time to return the correct state of the database. A database
 * checkpoint is represented by the state_node class. Reads and writes happen
 * against a state_node.
 *
 * States are organized as a tree with the assumption that one path wins out
 * over time and cousin paths are discarded as the root is advanced.
 *
 * Currently, database is not thread safe. That is, calls directly on database
 * are not thread safe. (i.e. deleting a node concurrently to creating a new
 * node can leave database in an undefined state)
 *
 * Conccurrency across state nodes is supported native to the implementation
 * without locks. Writes on a single state node need to be serialized, but
 * reads are implicitly parallel.
 *
 * TODO: Either extend the design of database to support concurrent access
 * or implement a some locking mechanism for access to the fork multi
 * index container.
 *
 * There is an additional corner case that is difficult to address.
 *
 * Upon squashing a state node, readers may be reading from the node that
 * is being squashed or an intermediate node between root and that node.
 * Relatively speaking, this should happen infrequently (on the order of once
 * per some number of seconds). As such, whatever guarantees concurrency
 * should heavily favor readers. Writing can happen lazily, preferably when
 * there is no contention from readers at all.
